  heading: The Entrepreneurial Hour
  description: >
       Welcome to The Entrepreneurial Hour (T.E.H.). It is held every Wednesday at 8 AM EST at Tech Alpharetta and virtually via Zoom. Entrepreneurs of all ages and at all stages from "dreamers" to early stage revenue
       producing companies are welcome to present. Entrepreneurs need to reassess their direction constantly during the early stages of bringing an idea to life. We offer you the chance to:  
       Practice your pitch for a friendly community.
       
       Present your company and build awareness.
       
       
       Think through a challenge you’re facing.
       Get fresh perspective on an issue.

  heading: What your mother won’t tell you.
  description: >
      This is a friendly community but not “friends and family.” Friends and family are very supportive and necessary to success and we give thanks for that. But they are not always objective or candid. We tell you what
      your mother won’t. This is tough love for the entrepreneur. We ask many questions of clarification and rigorously assess your ideas and marketability and the value of your opportunity or at least as much as time
      permits.
