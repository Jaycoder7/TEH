       Welcome to The Entrepreneurial Hour (T.E.H.). It is held every Wednesday at 8 AM EST at Tech Alpharetta and virtually via Zoom. Entrepreneurs of all ages and at all stages from "dreamers" to early stage revenue
       producing companies are welcome to present. Entrepreneurs need to reassess their direction constantly during the early stages of bringing an idea to life. We offer you the chance to:  
       Practice your pitch for a friendly community.
       
       Present your company and build awareness.
       
       
       Think through a challenge you’re facing.
       Get fresh perspective on an issue.

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.
        Email us or call the store for details.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
